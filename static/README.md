# 36dot22

## My contributions to [36 Days of Type](https://36daysoftype.com), 2022 Edition

My theme this year is mixing digital and physical, so I will be creating a p5js
sketch for each letter that integrates physical media in some way.

All of the finished pieces will be hosted on Gatsby Cloud @
[https://36dot22.gatsbyjs.io/]

some of them will be posted [on
metagram](https://instagram.com/bridgercreative) :scream:, where I am participating with
my co-workers.

May heaven help us all. :no_mouth:
